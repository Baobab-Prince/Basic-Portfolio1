  <p>My name is Chaz Carothers, and I am studying to become a web developer. I have a 4 year old boy who is the my entire world! My hobbies include solving Rubik's Cubes, knitting, origami, and playing piano and guitar. I listen to all types of music, and I used to play clarinet in the marching band (high school and college). I have traveled overseas to Italy by myself. Pisa, Rome, and Florence were the cities I was able to tour. I will always be proud of that individual journey I took. I can still feel the anticipation I felt as a 25 year old. I also must say that visiting Cuba with my sister was by far one of the most exciting trips of my life. I hope I will be able to travel the world more often with my son. I have been learning so much from this class. I can not wait to see what lies in store 6 months from now. Web development is not only a new hobby of mine, but I hope to make it a career. Another goal of mine is to learn how to code using different programming languages so well that I may be able to teach others how to do it as well. </p>
